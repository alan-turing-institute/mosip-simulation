# Simulating processes on MOSIP 
MOSIP ([mosip.io](http://mosip.io)) is a technology platform which helps governments and other organizations implement a digital, foundational identity system in a cost-effective way.

To help explore and understand MOSIP's operational behaviour, this repository will contain code for simulating a user interacting with the system. In particular, we focus on the [pre-registration journey](https://docs.mosip.io/platform/modules/pre-registration), where we simulate interactions with the pre-regitration UI using [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/). This approach may be used to [identify key operational data tap points](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/mosip-data-extraction) in the MOSIP database schema. A further aim of this repository relates to the development of anomaly detection capabilities. For the latter purpose, the code contained herein enables the simulation of pre-registration transactions, where dwell-times along the pre-registration journey are sampled from pre-configured statistical distributions. In this way, it is possible to simulate different users with pre-defined behavioural categories interacting with the system.
